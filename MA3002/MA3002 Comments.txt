- Course Difficulty: 3/5 
- Lecturers [Prof Tan Pei Yan, Prof Chow Wai Tuck, Prof Sellakutti Rajendran]: 4/5 to all

Energy methods portion was least intuitive, but just need to follow standard procedure. Don't require any real understanding (briefly covered)
Cracks is quite simple, just find the links between formulas and when to use which
Vibrations quite straightforward, many different cases but same overall methodology
