# ntu-pyps
Testbed for a Resource Database, especially for students' answers to PYPs since they are not made readily available. Also suitable for sharing high-effort cheatsheets.
Can be shared anonymously or otherwise.

Still working out a viable file system and naming convention. Possible categories include:
- Module Review and Comments
- Cheatsheets
- PYP Questions
- PYP Student Answers
- Other Resources

Possible features:
- Any form of student answers may be uploaded (e.g. .pdf, .docx), but a rating system may be implemented to filter out the best, most correct answers, with comments to indicate which questions may have errors.
